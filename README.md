Heart failure prediction using machine learning techniques identifies the possibility of whether a person has heart disease may take years of experience and intense medical tests.
Medical methods are complicated since they take more time and money to consume because they require many trials.
Also, other heart failure predictors using machine learning have below ninety percent accuracy. 
So, we need a system that can predict the possibility more accurately.

We will use the KNN algorithm, which is relatively more flexible than the SVM algorithm. 
We don't need to make additional assumptions or tune several parameters or build a model. We will gather 300 patients' datasets. 
There will be columns such as age, anemia, diabetes, ejection_fraction, high blood pressure, serum creatinine, sex, smoking, and death events in that dataset. 
This data is relatively easy to collect. It will help patients or doctors predict heart failure percentage, which will ultimately help save a life.

According To The Dataset 1 Means Having A Heart Failure 0 Means No.
In this project, the accuracy of heart failure prediction using machine learning  is 92%.
